    display: it controls how an element is rendered on the page
        does it take full width? does it go to next line? 
        can it have width/height? does it affect layout or disappear?
        display  block | inline | inline-block | none | flex | grid
        display:block -> used in div,p, h1-h6, header,footer,ul,li
            - starts on a new line
            - Takes 100% width by default
            - You can set width and height
            - Can apply margins and padding 

    display: inline -> eg, span, a, string, em
        - Does not start a new line
        - Takes only content width
        - Cannot set width and height
        - Top and bottom margin are ignored
        - Padding works, 
    
    display: inline:block combination of inline and block
     - stays inline
        - Does not start a new line
        - Takes only content width
    can set width height margin padding

    display: none -> kei pani dekhaudaina

    display:flex -> it gives us flexibility/ flexible box layout
        - Turns an element into a flex container.
        - Childrens become flex items.
        default behaviour: 
            flex-direction: row;
            justify-content: flex-start;
            align-items: stretch;

            Output: | item | item | item |

        flex-direction: row | coulumn;
        justify-content: flex-start | center | space-between | space-around;
        align-items: stretch | center | flex-start | flex-end;

        flex-wrap -> creating responsive layout, telling a flex container whether items should stay on 
        one line(nowrap, the default) or flow onto multiple lines (wrap) when they run out of space.
        
        Note: FLex is used for 1D design.

    display: grid -> it creates 2D layout system
        grid-tempalte-columns: 1fr 200px 2fr;





        position:
            
        static - by default. it is normal document flow.
        -   top/left does not work.

        relative - Element are still in flow but we can shift it.
            - It moves relative to it's original position.
            -- The space it occupied stays there.

        absolute - Element is removed from normal flow.
            - It looks for it's nearest positioned ancestor (non-static ancestor).
            =   If no positioned ancestor found, the viewport /body becomes the reference.
            - - The ancestor becoms the reference/ (0,0).
            - Absolute positioning says - place me inside my nearest positioned ancestor.

        Fixed - Like absolute but the coordinate saystem is always the viewport.
            - It does not care about parents.
            It odesnt move when scrolling.
            It is permanently pinned to the screen.
        sticky - It has a dynamic coordinate system.
            -It acts like relative in normal flow but when scrolling it reaches a 
                threshold and switches to fixed.
            - It is limited by it's parent's box, meaning it cannnot escape it's container.

        we have top, left, buttom, right. it moves the element accordingly.

        top:0px
        left:200px
        left:-200px;

    z-index - When two or more items are stacked on each other, 
                we can use z-index to determine who comes first and who goes to last.
